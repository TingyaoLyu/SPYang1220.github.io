Greetings! I'm Mingrui Zhang (张明瑞). I am a Research Scientist at [Meta Reality Labs], New York. I just graduated from the University of Washington [Information School] as a Ph.D. My advisor is Prof. [Jacob O. Wobbrock], who directs the [ACE Lab].

My research interests are in Human-Computer Interaction, specifically in inventing intelligent text entry methods that understand our intentions. Broadly speaking, I'm interested in improving and evaluating the technology that facilitates human communication process (e.g. smart speaker, auto correction/prediction), and making them accessible for people with different abilities.

Before moving to Seattle, I was a student of Computer Science & Technology in Tsinghua University, China, where I worked as a researcher as well as in industry. Back then, [Dr. Chun Yu] opened the world of HCI to me.

I enjoy playing computer games in my spare time, but you know, I rarely have spare time :) You can find me at [Zhihu], on Wechat official account <i>thisisdrustz</i>, a [featured news] and a [short profile] of me from UW iSchool.

“每个人都会经历这个阶段，看见一座山，就想知道山后面是什么。
我很想告诉他，可能翻过山后面，你会发觉没有什么特别。回头看会觉得这边更好。
但是他不会相信 —— 
以他的性格，自己不试过又怎会甘心？”
